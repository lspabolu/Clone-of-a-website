# Clone-of-a-website
Developed a clone of the Zomato website to enhance my skills and
familiarize myself with its comprehensive features. This project involved
replicating the user interface and functionality of the original site,
including restaurant listings, user reviews, search and filter options, and
online ordering capabilities. Through this process, I gained a deeper
understanding of UI design and development.
